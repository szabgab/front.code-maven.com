# Hello World using Vue with CDN

In this series we are going to load Vue from a fixed place. We are using a CDN, but you could also download Vue and serve it from your own web-site.
The main point is that this way of using Vue does NOT require a build step.


In the first example we create a simple variable and display its content.

{% embed include file="src/examples/hello-world-cdn/hw.html" %}
