# List of objects - for loop


In this example we have an object that contains and array of objects. We use a `v-for in`  loop to iterate over the elements of the array and then we use the dot-notation to access the individual attributes of the
JavaScript object. Coming from Python you might think of lists and dictionaries (or objects with accessors).
